During the current pandemic, it can be hard or even scary to go to the grocery store. (Animation of people in grocery store with masks)

Wouldn't it be better if you could grow your own food? (Animation of garden?)

A lot of people that were on the fence about starting vegetable gardens have taken the leap because of COVID-19.
 - Helps avoid the grocery store, which has long supply chains and a lot of unnecessary people touching your food
 - Eating more fruits and vegetables helps your immune system
 - Working in the garden is a great excuse to go outside and keep busy while we all #stayhome


Gardening is hard work, but the hardest part is knowing where to start.
Experienced farmers know what grows well in their soil and climate. We want to make it easier to share that information between neighbors.

Additionally, different soils and microclimates mean that something that grows well in one area might not do as well somewhere else

(Switch to computery animations)
Our algorithm, like anyone with minimal information, starts with the Agricultural Zone information about plants. This way,
even if no one else has used the system near you, you can still get some basic suggestions. (Screenshot of suggestions)


Once you've logged some yields for some plants, our suggestions will get smarter. (Screenshot of typing in Journal)


If anyone else has a garden near yours, that data will also be incorporated into the suggestions. Gardens closest to yours
will be weighted heavier and your own successes will factor in the most into what we suggest you grow and when.



Soon, we will add features to log the other activities in your garden, including pictures, garden type (pots, raised beds, etc), 
We also want to add reporting to encourage established farms to log their results as that data will be the most helpful!
