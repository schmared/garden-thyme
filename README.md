# Garden Thyme

This is a garden webapp that will let you log when you've planted, harvested, etc. different varieties of plants. The goal is to make it very smart and hyperlocal in recommending what and when to plant and harvest.


## How do we suggest what to plant?

Based on data we've collected from you and your neighbors, we will suggest plants that work well not only in your Agricultural Zone, but things that have grown well in your neighborhood. Hopefully this will make it easier to be successful in growing your own food!

Until we gather enough data, most of the suggestions will only be based on the Zone your garden is in. Once we have more information about what people are having success growing near you, that information will be factored into the suggestions.

Even in a small city, there are many microclimates and different soil compositions that will affect what you can grow. That means that you will probably have more success growing things that your neighbors have had success with.

We also take into account *when* things were planted outside to try to predict what will give you the best yield. This is why it's important to log when you plant and when you harvest (and how much you harvest!).


### Collecting Data

We only collect your location and anything you enter in the "Journal". No one will ever see your location or your specific collection of plants.

## Inspiration

This winter we started going to a local garden Co-op for a "Gardeners' Give and Take" meetup. The description from buffalorising.com:

> Every winter, Urban Roots hosts an event series where gardeners come together to discuss and plan strategies for the upcoming gardening season. Guests to the gatherings are invited to "ask questions, share successes and failures, bring your ideas and thoughts, while expanding your sense of gardening community."

Since we can't meet to discuss what is working and what is not, we figured an app would be a great supplement during the pandemic that will be useful to everyone long-term as well.

## Future Plans

Some immediate features we'd like to add include:
- Multiple gardens (including different locations) per user and multiple users per garden
- Different OAuth methods in addition to the Google login
- Logging and viewing comments and ratings per journal entry and plant
- Options for tracking (and suggestions based on) soil type, greenhouses, etc.
- ...

We intend to keep this site free as much as possible. This includes keeping it open source so that others can contribute (just shoot us a pull request!). For now it is hosted for free but as soon as there is any amount of traffic we will probably put ads on the site somewhere to help us host it. Eventually there may be a "premium" version to remove ads, but we do not intend to lock down any features because we'd like for this to be available to all members of the community. Everyone should be able to grow their own food!
